# Panasonic NV-HD750 general picture quality test

<hr>

Test tape was recorded with **BM Intensity Pro -> JVC HR-S7700EU (Y/C)** from Davinci Resolve, it contains:
* **SW** - Snell&Wilcox test chart
* **RES+COL** - resolution + color chart
* **RES** - pure B/W resolution test chart

> [!NOTE]
> Following screenshots were taken from BM Media Express. This is a straight capture, so ignore some color artifacts

### TL;DR: one of the best HF extensions, yet somewhat poor line stability
