## This is my repo for storing screen captures of different VCRs and video related stuff ðŸ¦Š

At the time of writing this README (28.03.2025) I have 2 "test" tapes:
- PAL color bars, recorded on **Panasonic NV-SD400** from hardware generator built in **DataVideo TBC-7000**
- PAL color bars with overlays & timecode, recorded on **JVC HR-J791AM** from Adobe Premiere Pro DV timeline using **Blackmagic Intensity Pro** 

First one being **_bars_** and second - _**foxbars**_ (because of my foxxo logo in the top left)

**03.04.2025 UPD:** new test tape was recorded with **BM Intensity Pro -> JVC HR-S7700EU (Y/C)** from Davinci Resolve, it contains:
* Snell&Wilcox test chart
* resolution + color chart
* pure B/W resolution test chart
